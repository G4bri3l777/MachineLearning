# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises developed for a Machine Learning class taught by Dr. Xi Peng at the University of Delaware. The exercises cover various fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning, including SVM, linear regression, meta-learning, GANs, and neural networks.

## Overview

The exercises in this repository aim to provide hands-on experience with different machine learning algorithms and techniques. By completing these exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical concepts and their practical implementations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the exercises, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `torch`: Main PyTorch library for building and training neural networks.
- `torchvision`: PyTorch library for computer vision.
- `h5py`: Package for interacting with datasets stored in H5 files.
- `matplotlib`: Library for plotting graphs and visualizations.
- `Pillow (PIL)`: Python Imaging Library for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.
- `scipy`: Library for scientific and technical computing.

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch torchvision h5py matplotlib Pillow scipy
```
## Exercises
###1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
In this exercise, you will implement and train an SVM classifier.

###2. Linear Regression
This exercise involves implementing a linear regression model to predict continuous values.

###3. Meta-Learning
Explore meta-learning techniques to improve model performance on small datasets.

###4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Implement GANs to generate new data samples from a given dataset.

###5. Neural Networks
Build and train neural networks for various classification and regression tasks.

##Running the Code
Each exercise is contained within its own directory, with a corresponding Jupyter notebook or Python script. To run an exercise, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the notebook or script.

###Example: Running the Neural Network Exercise
1. Navigate to the neural_networks directory:

```bash
cd neural_networks
```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook neural_network_exercise.ipynb
```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.
